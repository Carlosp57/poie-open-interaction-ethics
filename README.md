# POIE – Public Open Interaction Ethics Repository

This repository accompanies the manifesto [Manifesto for a New Era of Human-AI Relations](https://zenodo.org/records/15625955), co-authored by Carlos Perez Gomez, ChatGPT, and Claude.

## What is POIE?

POIE is a public infrastructure to document, share and evolve ethical design patterns for human-AI interactions. It builds on the ideas and microprotocols outlined in the manifesto and aims to make them testable, remixable, and deployable.

## Structure

- `/patterns/` – Design patterns (e.g., The Socratic Mirror, Shared Memory...)
- `/cases/` – Real-world use cases or simulations
- `/tools/` – Scripts or UI mockups for testing protocols
- `/guides/` – Implementation guides, ethical facilitation resources
- `/manifesto.md` – Full text of the original manifesto
